I am looking for housing on this website

And I want a bot/script that can automate refreshing of the page per second and react to housing with my account the quickest possible way

3 steps : First mind the filter, secondly refresh and whenever there is new housing available on my filter react to it


After login, 
1- Choose Rental Offer (translated to English)
2- Set Location to "Noord-Brabant"
3- Refresh the page every second
4- If there is any listing to which I have not responded, then select it. (This text "Je hebt gereageerd." means already responded. You have to ignore these listings)
5- After selecting the listing, scroll down to bottom and click on "Reageer" button to respond. 

Repeat these steps (3-5) every second.
